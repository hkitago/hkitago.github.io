# Screen Props App Project

This project is currently in the experimental stage and aims to develop applications for filming movies, TV shows, or displaying various content.

## Project Overview

Here is a showcase of a browser-based app designed for Android devices. The animated GIF demonstrates the app's functionality: transitioning from one page to another with a progress bar displayed in full-screen mode upon tapping the screen.

I plan to deploy these applications as Progressive Web Apps (PWA) before developing native versions. You can find more of my work in my portfolio on [this page](https://screenprops.tumblr.com).
